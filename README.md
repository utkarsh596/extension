# Codechef-Notifier

CodeChef is a platform for many aspiring coders 💪 to improve their coding skills. It is a very frequent problem with CodeChef that its servers are so overloaded that submission made to the judge takes a very long time to obtain the verdict. The coders are left with no option but to check the page repeatedly after some interval to check if the verdict is available or not.


Through this extension,👨‍🍳 we aim to remove this extra effort of checking the submission page to know the verdict of our submission. Using this extension we will automate the process of capturing the submission request and pinging the REST API of CodeChef responsible for giving the verdict repeatedly at some interval until the verdict is obtained. When the verdict is available, this extension will inform the user using desktop notifications so that the user can check the detailed status of their submission.

Why not to get experience of what it is by using it ?👨‍💻
